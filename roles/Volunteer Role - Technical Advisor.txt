Volunteer Role Title:
Technical Advisor (Volunteer)
Reports to:
Founder & Executive Director, Muslim Open Source Foundation
Commitment:
3–6 hours per week (flexible, remote, volunteer basis)
Overview
The Muslim Open Source Foundation (MOSF) is a nonprofit based in Washington State, USA, dedicated to empowering the global Muslim community through open-source collaboration, education, and ethical technology.
As a Technical Advisor (Volunteer), you’ll play a key mentorship and guidance role during MOSF’s earliest projects, starting with the Basic Arabic Reading program, a self-paced open-source learning tool for English speakers with no prior Arabic knowledge.
You’ll help maintain balance between vision and execution: ensuring that our technical work stays purposeful, scalable, and aligned with MOSF’s educational and ethical goals. You won’t be hands-on in every commit, but you’ll be instrumental in shaping how the team works, guiding technical decisions, and keeping us from designing ourselves into a corner.
This is a volunteer position offering the opportunity to influence the foundation’s earliest systems, processes, and standards, insha Allah.

* Serve as a sounding board and tiebreaker between product direction (led by the Founder) and implementation (led by volunteer engineers).
* Help define a clear and scalable technical path for Basic Arabic Reading and similar educational tools.
* Identify potential pitfalls early, from design complexity to usability or sustainability concerns.


Mentorship & Collaboration
* Support and advise volunteer developers as they contribute to repositories.

* Provide occasional input on project evaluation frameworks and other technical initiatives as the foundation expands.
Ideal Candidate
* 8+ years of software engineering or technical leadership experience, ideally spanning both startup and product environments.
* Comfortable mentoring and advising developers on architecture, design trade-offs, and engineering best practices.
* Broad technical understanding across backend, frontend, and cloud stacks (e.g., AWS, .NET, Node.js, or similar).
* Excellent communicator who can bridge vision and execution with empathy and clarity.
* Values-driven professional motivated by open knowledge, ethical technology, and service to the ummah.
